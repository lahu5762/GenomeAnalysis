AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH/species (in this case augustus_config/durio_zibethinus) is not writeable.
There are 3 alternative ways to set this variable for braker.pl:
   a) provide command-line argument --AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your/path
   b) use an existing environment variable $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH
      for setting the environment variable, run
           export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your/path
      in your shell. You may append this to your .bashrc or
      .profile file in order to make the variable available to all
      your bash sessions.
   c) braker.pl can try guessing the location of
      $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH from an augustus executable that is
      available in your $PATH variable.
      If you try to rely on this option, you can check by typing
           which augustus
      in your shell, whether there is an augustus executable in
      your $PATH
      Be aware: the $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH must be writable for
                braker.pl because braker.pl is a pipeline that
                optimizes parameters that reside in that
                directory. This might be problmatic in case you
                are using a system-wide installed augustus 
                installation that resides in a directory that is
                not writable to you as a user.
