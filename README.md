# GenomeAnalysis

This project partially replicates the results of [Tean Teh et al.'s paper 'The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)'](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3972). See [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/lahu5762/GenomeAnalysis/wiki) for an in-deph explanation of the project and code.

Though the scripts itself should work in any setting, this code was originally run on modified data made available by [Uppsala University](https://uu.se/) and the [Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC)](https://snic.se/). The data is a modified version of the data published by Tean Teh et al. (2017) and contained long-read PacBio, short-read Illumina, trimmed & untrimmed transcriptome data describing the Durio zibethinus.
