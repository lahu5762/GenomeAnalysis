# GenomeAnalysis

This project partially replicates the results of Tean Teh et al.'s paper 'The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)'. See GitHub Wiki for an in-deph explanation of the project and code.

Though the scripts itself should work in any setting, this code was originally run on modified data made available by Uppsala University and the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC). The data is a modified version of the data published by Tean Teh et al. (2017) and contained long-read PacBio, short-read Illumina, trimmed & untrimmed transcriptome data describing the Durio zibethinus.
